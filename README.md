## ⚙️ Installation

### Method 1: Manual Installation

1. **Fork this repository:** Click the Fork button located in the top-right corner of this page.
2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Code-Sync.git
   ```
3. **Create .env file:**
   Inside the client and server directories create `.env` and set:

   Frontend:

   ```bash
   VITE_BACKEND_URL=<your_server_url>
   ```

   Backend:

   ```bash
   PORT=3000
   JUDGE0_URL=http://localhost:2358
   GEMINI_API_KEY=<your_gemini_api_key>
   GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-flash-latest
   ```

   Notes:
   - The app now executes code through your backend using Judge0-compatible endpoints.
   - Run a local Judge0 CE instance (for example with Docker) and keep `JUDGE0_URL` pointed to it.

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install     # Run in both client and server directories
   ```
5. **Start the servers:**
   Frontend:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```
   Backend:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm run dev
   ```
6. **Access the application:**
   ```bash
   http://localhost:5173/
   ```
